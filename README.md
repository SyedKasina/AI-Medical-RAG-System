# 🧠 AI-Based Medical Record Analysis System using BioBERT, RAG, and Explainable AI

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end AI system for automated medical record analysis** using state-of-the-art **Biomedical NLP**, **Deep Learning**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. The system is designed to process **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**, understand complex clinical language, retrieve relevant medical evidence, generate accurate clinical insights, and **explain model decisions transparently**.

The architecture follows modern AI best practices and is suitable for **academic research, final-year projects, and real-world clinical decision support prototypes**.

## 🧩 Core Components Explained

### 1️⃣ Data Sources

The system uses **publicly available, anonymized medical datasets**, ensuring ethical compliance:

* MIMIC-III / MIMIC-IV (sample or derived datasets)
* eICU Collaborative Research Dataset
* PhysioNet clinical text samples
* Kaggle EHR & clinical NLP datasets

> ⚠️ **Note**: No private or identifiable patient data is used.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing Pipeline

Implemented using **Pandas and NumPy**:

* Text cleaning (HTML removal, punctuation normalization)
* Lowercasing and token normalization
* Stopword handling (domain-aware)
* Sentence segmentation for long clinical notes
* Conversion to model-ready formats

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

---

### 3️⃣ Biomedical NLP with BioBERT

* Model: `dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1`
* Framework: Hugging Face Transformers + PyTorch
* Purpose:

  * Understand clinical terminology
  * Generate contextual embeddings for medical text

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
```

BioBERT embeddings serve as the **semantic backbone** of the system.

---

### 4️⃣ Sequence Modeling & Classification

To handle structured predictions:

* **Bi-LSTM** layers capture temporal dependencies
* Fully Connected layers perform classification tasks such as:

  * Disease category prediction
  * Clinical risk tagging

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
```

---

### 5️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The RAG pipeline improves factual correctness by grounding responses in retrieved data.

#### 🔹 Dense Embedding Storage

* BioBERT embeddings stored in **FAISS** vector index

```python
import faiss
```

#### 🔹 Retrieval

* Nearest-neighbor search retrieves clinically similar records

#### 🔹 Generation

* Generator models:

  * BART (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`)
  * T5 (`t5-base`)

The generator produces **evidence-supported clinical outputs**.

---

### 6️⃣ Explainable AI (XAI)

To avoid black-box predictions:

#### 🔍 SHAP

* Global and local feature importance
* Explains word-level impact on predictions

#### 🔍 LIME

* Instance-level interpretability
* Highlights influential medical terms

```python
import shap
import lime
```

This ensures **trust, transparency, and regulatory readiness**.
